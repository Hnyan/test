        “One of the first use cases of semi-transparent colors was using them as backgrounds, over photographic or otherwise busy backdrops, to decrease contrast and make the text possible to read. The result is quite impressive, but can still be hard to read, especially with very low opacity colors and/or busy backdrops. For example, take a look at Figure XX.XX, where the main element has a semi-transparent white background. ”
